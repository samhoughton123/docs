## Authentication

All endpoints require an api key passed in the header.

```json
  {
    "x-api-key": ""
  }
```

## Requests

All data will be returned via a webook which can be specified when making the request. The webhook response can be found under `Option 2` in the endpoint pages.

## OpenAPI 3.0

We can provide an **OpenAPI** spec if required.
