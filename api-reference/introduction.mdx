## Authentication

All endpoints require an api key passed in the header.

```json
  {
    "x-api-key": ""
  }
```

## Requests

All data will be returned via a webook which can be specified when making the request. The webhook response can be found under `Option 2` in the endpoint pages.

### Webhook Status
All webhook responses will recieve a status of one of the following: `success`, `failed`, `not-found`. Credits will only be consumed when a status of success is returned. 

* `success` - We successfully found the data for the given company. <br />
* `failed` - We found data for the company but there was an issue processing it. <br />
* `not-found` - We were unable to find data for the company. <br />

## Environments
Both environments will require use of an api key.

### Testing
Our testing endpoint will return a webhook response to you immediately. The data that comes back will always be for the same company (Acme Ltd) but will have a varying webhook id:

``` https://testing.inbound.generatemomentum.ai/api/remote  ```

### Live
The live endpoint will return a webhook response, which consumes credits

``` https://inbound.generatemomentum.ai/api/remote  ```


## OpenAPI 3.0

We can provide an **OpenAPI** spec if required.
